The files provided define an interface for a graph implementation. You will need to
implement the Graph, Node, and Edge classes. Additionally, you will need to implement
an IGraphReader that can read in a directed graph from a file. You are free to use any
of the data structures you have implemented this block to help with implementation of 
your graph class.

The included graph file has three nodes and three edges. "node1" connects to "node2" with 
an edge of weight 5.5, "node1" connects to "node3" with an edge of weight -0.2, and
"node2" connects to "node3" with a weight of 1.2.

Scaffold code for the class to read a graph from file has been provided. The value at 
each node using the reader should be the String name of the node. Fill in the missing 
logic for DiGraphReader.java; when the code is working you should get the following 
output:
node1 -> node2  w: 5.5
node1 -> node3  w: -0.2
node2 -> node3  w: 1.2
