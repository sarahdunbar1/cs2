You should copy in your graph implementation from day11 including the DiGraphReader. You will use your graph implementation to support implementing two different path finding algorithms. DepthFirstSearcher will implement a depth first graph search and conform to the ISearcher interface. BreadthFirstSearcher will implement a breadth first graph search and conform to the ISearcher interface.

We will test your searcher implementations with several graph files. Sometimes a path will exist from the starting node to the target node, sometimes there will not be a path.

You should feel free to use any data structures you have implemented earlier in the block when implementing your searchers.
